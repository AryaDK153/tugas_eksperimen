# Guide for TE1
TestRun the codes with [main](main.py)

See code implementation and documentation for:
1. [Bidirectional-Conditional-Insertion-Sort](bcis.py)
2. [Counting-Sort](counting_sort.py)

I have also provided an algorithm to [generate a random dataset](generate_dataset.py) with *n* length to show that the codes work not just for the provided [testcases](dataset.txt). Inside, you can find 2 algorithms, one for generating a certain *n* length dataset instantly, one for generating and saving datasets into dataset.txt.
